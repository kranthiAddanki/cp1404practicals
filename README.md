# CP1404_KA Practicals
## Kranthi's Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

This repo contains the programs that were written as a part of
CP1404 teaching in 2024_TR3.
* Do not repeat yourself is a key lesson
* Follow PEP8 convention
* using doc strings in the programs as code is read and reused than it is being actually rewritten

Also, this repo is mainly based on the instructions from [Programming Patterns page](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns) and
[CP1404 Practical instructions](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals).
